# Manipulation Baseline
We adopt [UniVLA](https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/AgiBot-World/tree/manipulation-challenge/UniVLA) and [RDT](https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/AgiBot-World/tree/manipulation-challenge/RDT) as baseline models for the [AgiBot World Challenge @ IROS 2025](https://agibot-world.com/challenge) - Manipulation track.

### :one: Dataset Downloading

- Download the simdata from <td><a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/agibot-world/AgiBotWorldChallenge-2025/tree/main/Manipulation-SimData">Manipulation-SimData</a></td> for challenge phase1.

- Download the realrobot data from <td><a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/agibot-world/AgiBotWorldChallenge-2025/tree/main/Manipulation-RealRobot">Manipulation-RealRobotData</a></td> for challenge phase2.

- Pretraining on more public data is allowed. If needed, download the AgibotWorld-Alpha dataset from <td><a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/agibot-world/AgiBotWorld-Alpha">AgibotWorld-Alpha</a></td>, or the AgibotWorld-Beta dataset (larger) from <td><a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/agibot-world/AgiBotWorld-Beta">AgibotWorld-Beta</a></td>.

## :rocket: Submission
After completing local debugging, you can submit your work on our <td><a href="https://agibot-world.com/challenge/manipulation/my-submissions">test server</a></td>. Please note the following points:

- You need to compress your code repository into a ZIP file before submission.
- In your code repository, there must be a directory named `scripts`, and within this directory, there must be a file named `infer.py` for model inference. For the `infer.py` file, you need to have a parameter named `task_name` which can take the values of the 10 task names in our competition. For specific details, please refer to the <td><a href="https://github.com/OpenDriveLab/AgiBot-World/blob/manipulation-challenge/UniVLA/scripts/infer.py">inference script example</a></td> we provided. After you complete the submission, our test server will execute the default command `omni_python scripts/infer.py --task_name [task_name]` and iterate through all the tasks in sequence.
- In your code repository, you must include the file `genie_sim_ros.py`, which is used for data communication between the model and the simulation environment. You can directly copy the file we provided. Of course, if needed, you can modify it yourself.
- In your code repository, you also need to provide the model checkpoint. By default, you should place the checkpoint in the directory `checkpoints/finetuned` and set the parameters "pretrained_checkpoint" and "action_decoder_path" in `scripts/infer.py` to `checkpoints/finetuned` (taking UniVLA as an example). Of course, you can change the location of the checkpoint as needed, as long as you also update the path parameters in `scripts/infer.py` accordingly.
- If there are any new Python dependencies required, you need to list them in a `requirements.txt` file and upload it when submitting to the test server. For UniVLA and RDT, no new dependencies are needed, so you can simply submit an empty `requirements.txt` file (but it must be submitted). It is recommended that you thoroughly debug and validate locally before uploading.
